A [paradelle](http://www.shadowpoetry.com/resources/wip/paradelle.html) is a poetic form devised by Billy Collins, in which words are introduced in the first lines/stanzas, then reused & rearranged in later lines/the final stanza.

This editor app helps you keep track of which words you have already used, aiding in the writing process.
