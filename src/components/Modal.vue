        <p>The paradelle is a rigid, modern poetic form.</p>

        <blockquote>
          Billy Collins originally said the paradelle was invented in
          11th-century France, but he later admitted that he invented it himself
          to parody strict forms of poetry, particularly the
          <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanelle"
            >villanelle</a
          >. His sample paradelle, "Paradelle for Susan" (c. 1997), was
          seemingly intentionally terrible, completing the final stanza with the
          line "Darken the mountain, time and find was my into it was with to
          to".

          Despite it's satirical beginnings, people have gone on to write some
          very beautiful paradelles. The tricky part is that you must re-use
          words introduced in previous couplets and stanzas in later couplets
          and stanzas. This editor exists to help you keep track of the words
          you need to use.
